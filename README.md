# IE Knowledgebase

Free, open courses on industrial engineering, quality and continuous improvement. Courses are grouped into the same categories used by the IISE professional course catalog, plus a few added for subjects it does not cover, under `courses/<category>/<course>/`.

## Courses

New to industrial engineering? Start with [Introduction to Industrial Engineering](courses/technical-skills/introduction-to-industrial-engineering/README.md), the broad entry point, then pick a category.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for a checklist of what is built and what is still open in each category, and [VISION.md](VISION.md) for where the site is going: a role advisor that turns a target position into a training plan grounded in the official standard for the role and in what the market asks for.

[![Roadmap graph](public/roadmap.svg)](public/roadmap.svg)

**Interactive site:** <https://nidhy.dev/ie-knowledgebase/> has a catalog by category, a learning path ordered by prerequisites with local progress tracking, a mind map, and an on-site reader for every course and module. It is generated into `public/` by `python tools/roadmap_graph.py`; GitHub Pages publishes the repo root, so the site reads the course files in place.

Suggested order: Measurement & Basic Statistics, Process Mapping and Voice of the Customer, then Charting Process Behavior, then Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing, then Design for Six Sigma, then Root Cause Analysis. Kaizen Leader and Lean Methods Accelerator have no prerequisites and can be taken at any point.

## Adding a course

1. Pick the category folder under `courses/` that fits, and create `courses/<category>/<course-name>/` (lowercase, hyphenated).
2. Include `README.md` (objectives + syllabus), `modules/`, and `solutions/`, `data/`, `tools/` as needed.
3. Follow the module structure in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), then add a row to the category README and to the table above.

## Status, review and legal

Every course is written with AI assistance and is marked `draft` in the tables above until a reviewer has completed [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md); it then reads `verified (Name, YYYY-MM-DD)`. The review board (`/review-course <slug>` in Claude Code) does the checking and writes its report to [reviews/](reviews/README.md); a person answers its questions and signs off. The site shows the same status on each course. The project is not affiliated with IISE: only the public catalog's course titles and topic lists were used, as a coverage map. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md), and the site's [Privacy Policy](https://nidhy.dev/ie-knowledgebase/privacy.html) and [Terms of Use](https://nidhy.dev/ie-knowledgebase/terms.html) (sources in `tools/legal/`).
